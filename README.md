# lostplaces

The purpose of the Lost Places Map is to collaboratively map the places in Lexington that we have lost. These can be places that no longer physically exist, or that have disappeared in other ways. A business that has closed, a house where a loved one once lived. The places don't need to be of significance to the whole of Lexington, it is enough that they were important to you.

The places and stories collected here will be incorporated into a walking map of the city and made available to the public at The Plantory during the May 19th Gallery Hop.

The Lost Places Map is a part of The Plantory's Neighborhood Art Project, made possible by a grant from the Blue Grass Community Foundation through a partnership with the Kresge Foundation and the NoLi CDC.
